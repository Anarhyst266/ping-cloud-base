# This defines the ingress for the pingaccess management console.

# NOTE: it will only work if an ingress controller (e.g. nginx) is running on
# your cluster.

# FIXME: Change ingress controller certificate to CA-signed certificate.
# FIXME: Currently the LB is registered with a wildcard CNAME on Scalr for the
#        pingcloud sub-domain under ping-eng.com. Change it to some other
#        external DNS service (e.g. Route53) instead.
# FIXME: Make pingaccess listen on non-secure port so SSL can be terminated at
#        the LB.
